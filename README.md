This is a clicker game just like a cookie clicker

This was made for a YouTube video by SpiderMonkey

All the code was made by ChatGPT, so I can take no credit for codding this
You can see how in this Youtube video: (LINK)

Instead of it being cookie it is themed off of Gorilla Tag
instead of clicking cookies, you are mining shiny rocks

It has the same basis as a cookie clicker
  1. click/mine
  2. gather more clicks/shiny rocks
  3. upgrade
  4. Ascend
  5. unlock ALL achievements
